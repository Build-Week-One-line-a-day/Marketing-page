                    still write something about my day. Whether it be a goal or an<br> 
                    acheivement, I get to look back and look at the little steps
                    I have taken over time.<br> The little things make a huge impact."

                     and keep it up for the ten years. This is a great start, and it's 
                     handy to have that journal in an app."
